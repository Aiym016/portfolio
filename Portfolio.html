                    <p>I am a first-year student, I still have no experience in the field of my future profession. I have many interests and hobbies, such as cooking, reading books of Russian literature(my most favorite book is Anna Karenina, I advise everyone to read it, especially girls, I also love reading biographies of Russian poets, even if I don't remember anything), I also like movies/TV series of the Middle Ages, they are very aesthetic. I spent 4 years in karate, 1 year in cheerleading, and now I spend all my free time studying. I have a lot of goals for the future, but right now I'm just a typical, tormented student. Thanks for your attention!</p>
